// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE MONEY QUESTION (G-3-2): a mid-turn heartbeat and the turn-end checkpoint that follows it
// must not bill the same tokens twice.
//
// WHY THE REAL DELTA ENGINE IS USED HERE. Every other checkpoint test injects
// `computeDelta: () => ({ nextCursor: 4, segments: [...] })`. Such a test can say nothing at all
// about double-billing, because PARTITIONING is exactly what the stub replaces. So these tests
// write a real rollout, grow it between passes the way a live turn does, and let
// lib/delta-codex.mjs decide the windows.
//
// THE ARGUMENT THE TESTS PIN. A segment id is `${sessionId}:${fromLine}-${toLine}` and the server
// upserts on `segmentId::model`. Within one window, runs break ONLY at (repoRoot, branch)
// transitions, which sit at ABSOLUTE line numbers — so where a window is cut has no effect on any
// boundary except the cut itself. The window is `[state.cursor, nextCursor)`, and emitting the
// segments and advancing the cursor happen inside ONE rank-2 session-lock transaction. Therefore
// the turn-end checkpoint's window begins exactly one line past where the heartbeat's ended:
// disjoint line ranges, disjoint segment ids, every token billed once.
//
// THE ONE CONDITION, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. That rests entirely on segment emission and cursor
// advance being in the same lock-held transaction. The single path that breaks the pairing is a
// transaction that LOSES its lock mid-run: lib/checkpoint.mjs gates the state write on
// stillOwnsSession, so segments are emitted and the cursor is not advanced. The replay then covers
// a SUPERSET window and repartitions it. That hazard is pre-existing and identical on today's
// git-boundary + Stop pair; the heartbeat neither creates it nor widens it — by advancing the
// cursor more often it makes the un-advanced window SHORTER. The last test in this file is that
// case, pinned rather than papered over.
