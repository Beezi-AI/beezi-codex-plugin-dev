# Beezi: crash reporting

Crash reporting is **off by default** and stays off until the user says otherwise. It covers
failures *inside the Beezi plugin itself* — every Beezi hook swallows its own errors, so when the
plugin breaks, nothing anywhere records it. It has nothing to do with the session analytics the
plugin is for: those are unaffected by this setting, in either direction.

This works on a machine that is **not linked**. Consent to crash reporting must never require
signing in first, so do not send the user through the `login` skill to answer it.

## Running it

This file is at `<plugin-root>/skills/telemetry/SKILL.md`, so the script sits beside it at
`<plugin-root>/skills/telemetry/telemetry.mjs`:

```
node "<plugin-root>/skills/telemetry/telemetry.mjs"
```

That reports the current setting and never changes the answer. (The very first time, it also
records that the question was *put* — which is not an answer, and is what stops the user being
asked the same thing every session.) To change the answer, pass exactly one argument:

```
node "<plugin-root>/skills/telemetry/telemetry.mjs" on
node "<plugin-root>/skills/telemetry/telemetry.mjs" off
```

Report the output verbatim. Do not read, open, or inspect any other files, and never edit the
stored answer by hand.

**Only run `on` or `off` when the user has actually said which one they want.** A request to
"check", "show", or "what is this" is the no-argument form. Consent is the user's to give: never
infer it from enthusiasm, never turn it on as a favour because it would help debugging, and never
turn it off pre-emptively either — the no-argument form is always the safe answer to an ambiguous
question.

## What the output means

- **is OFF — the default. This machine has not been asked before** — the user is being asked the
  question for the first time. Relay the whole message; it contains the question and what a report
  contains. Then stop and let them answer. Merely showing it is recorded as *asked*, which is not
  consent — it stays off, nothing is recorded, and they will not be asked again.
- **is OFF — the default. You were asked on `<date>` and have not answered** — the question was
  already put and never answered. That is a complete, valid state: it is off, nothing has been
  recorded and nothing sent. Do not re-ask; say what the setting is and offer both directions once.
- **is OFF — you turned it off on `<date>`** — a deliberate no. Do not re-offer it. Answer what the
  setting is if asked, and leave it there.
- **is ON (turned on `<date>`)** — reporting. Mention that `off` also deletes whatever is still held
  on the machine.
- **is now ON** / **is now OFF** — the change was saved.
- **Could not save the choice** — the answer did not reach disk. On the `on` path nothing changed
  and the machine is still off. On the `off` path everything held locally was deleted anyway, but
  the machine may still be on, so this one is worth escalating: the Beezi home directory is not
  writable.

## What is collected, if the user asks

A report is structured fields only: which failure it was (one of a short fixed list of codes),
which plugin file and line it happened in, the error class and error code, an HTTP status when
there was one, the plugin / Node / OS / architecture versions, and how many times it repeated.

It **cannot** carry code, prompts, file contents, any path outside the plugin, repository or branch
names, error messages, stack text, tokens or credentials. That is not a filter that strips them —
the record has no field that could hold them in the first place.

Answer from this section. Do not go and read the plugin's source to compose an answer.

## The default, and what "never answering" means

If the user never answers, the setting stays **off**: nothing is recorded, nothing is queued, and
nothing is sent. The gate is checked before a report is even composed, so a later `on` reports only
what happens *after* it — turning it on never ships anything gathered beforehand.

Turning it **off** deletes every report still held on the machine, so a period of reporting cannot
be re-opened later.

The answer is stored on this machine only, at the root of the Beezi home directory, and is not part
of the session data the plugin uploads.
