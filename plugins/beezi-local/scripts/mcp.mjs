// The variable name and the accepted values below are `WATCHER_ENV_VAR` and `isWatcherEnabled`
// from lib/rollout-watcher.mjs, which is the authority on both. They are repeated here for ONE
// reason: this check runs before the dynamic import, so an un-opted machine never loads the
// watcher's module graph — checkpoint, session-audit, coverage and the lock primitive — at all.
// Importing the module to ask it would defeat the gate.
//
// It is an allowlist, not a truthiness test, for the same reason isWatcherEnabled is one:
// `BEEZI_CODEX_WATCHER=0` and `=false` are what a user types to turn something OFF, and both are
// truthy strings. Anything else about the decision belongs in startWatcher(), and
// test/watcher-optin.test.mjs asserts the two copies cannot drift.
//
// `.mcp.json` now forwards BEEZI_CODEX_WATCHER, so this gate is the only one left: the production
// cutover it was sequenced behind has shipped (G-1-2, R1). Default still OFF — a machine gets a
// watcher when it asks for one. What is gone is the second lock that made asking impossible.
// R-numbers cite docs/plans/2026-09-10-sections/REVIEW.md.
//
// The plan's release order puts delivery automation after the production cutover and its guarded
// migration (repo-root docs/plans/2026-09-10-codex-gap-closure-plan.md, "Release order"), so
// shipping this opt-in is the requirement, not a precaution.
