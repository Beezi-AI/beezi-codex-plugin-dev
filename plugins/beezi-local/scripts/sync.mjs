// The repeatable history repair pass (G-3-3 engine, G-9-3 surface).
//
// This is NOT the one-time import. It asks Beezi how far each session already reaches and uploads
// only what is missing above that point, so it is safe to run as often as the user likes and it
// neither consumes nor reopens the one-time backfill's seal.
//
// It reaches back 30 days and no further: MAX_SESSION_AGE_MS in lib/session-audit.mjs is shared
// policy, so a session out of scope for the one-time import is out of scope here too.
//
// It takes ONE FLAG — `--account`, which scopes the run to a single linked account — and the two
// refusals below are the mechanical enforcement of the flags it still does not take:
//
//   --since filters on the transcript's modification time, which says when a session last RAN, not
//   what Beezi is missing. It would silently exclude exactly the old half-uploaded session this
//   command exists to repair.
//
//   --force exists on the import to skip the LOCAL seal caches. There is no seal on this path to
//   force past, so accepting the flag would only advertise a bypass that does not exist — and
//   invite the model to reach for it the moment the one-time import refuses.
//
// With no --account the run repeats for EVERY linked account in turn. That is not wasteful
// duplication: /sessions/coverage answers for the account whose bearer asked, so a run for one
// account establishes nothing about what another is missing.
//
// An account in several workspaces repeats once per workspace its rules and New folders reach, for
// the same reason: each workspace answers coverage for itself. `--tenant <workspace[,…]>` (with
// --account when several accounts are linked) overrides that and sends those workspaces every past
// session, unrouted.
//
// `--dry-run` builds everything and sends nothing, so a run can be previewed.
