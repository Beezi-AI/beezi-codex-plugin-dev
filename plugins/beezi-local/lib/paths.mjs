// entry (`lib/credentials.mjs` SERVICE). NOTHING KEYED OFF IT MAY BE NAMESPACED INDEPENDENTLY.
// A build whose keyring entry says `beezi-codex-staging` but whose data root is still
// `~/.beezi-codex` holds a staging token over production cursors, and every queued segment then
// flushes to the wrong tenant.
//
// Codex's own roots (`codexHome()` and its children, further down) are NOT suffixed: they belong
// to Codex, not to this plugin, and both variants read the same transcripts.

// The only environment names that may reach a filesystem path or a PowerShell credential template.
// '' is production. An unlisted name is a broken build — never a silent fall-through to production
// (R1), and never interpolated anywhere. R-numbers cite docs/plans/2026-09-10-sections/REVIEW.md.
