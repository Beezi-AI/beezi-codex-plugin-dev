// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A Codex turn can run for hours with no Stop and no git boundary, and until one of those arrives
// nothing is checkpointed: no token segments, no timeline, no rate-limit drain, no cursor advance.
// If the terminal is closed mid-turn, Stop never fires and the whole turn is lost. This bounds
// that wait by riding the PostToolUse hook that is ALREADY registered for every tool
// (lib/hooks-install.mjs sets MATCH_ALL = '.*'), so it costs no new hook entry, no registry write
// and no second /hooks trust step — which, given Codex's trust gate, is the expensive part.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN timing.mjs AND NOT IN checkpoint.mjs. The gate runs on EVERY tool call, and
// the checkpoint engine pulls ~28 modules that all but one firing in a hundred discards. Measured
// on this machine, cold process, Node v24.11.1: importing lib/checkpoint.mjs costs 139 ms;
// importing this module's whole closure (paths + fs-store + compat, all four node builtins deep)
// costs 25 ms. The gated path must stay at roughly bare node startup or the heartbeat becomes a
// per-tool-call stall, which is the exact failure this row must not ship. Keeping it beside
// IDLE_GAP_SEC also keeps every wall-clock threshold this plugin owns in one file.

// `<id>.agents` filenames, and pruneStale sweeps everything by mtime. A marker wearing `.json`
// would be an empty file handed to a JSON parser, and a filename minted into a session id — G-3-1
// again, in the directory G-3-1 was about. `<id>.agents` (lib/subagent-state.mjs) is the precedent
// for a third shape living here; test/heartbeat-wiring.test.mjs pins that all three readers ignore
// this one and that prune still reclaims it.

//
//   * Parallel tool completions racing here at worst double-run one checkpoint, which is harmless:
//     the second run takes the same rank-2 session lock the first holds and defers, and even if it
//     did not, the server upserts by `segmentId::model`.
//   * A checkpoint that dies — killed hook, thrown engine, an exhausted budget — waits out the
//     interval instead of retrying on the very next tool call. That is what bounds a hot loop:
//     at most one heartbeat attempt per session per interval, whatever happens downstream.
//   * A run that DEFERS on a busy session lock also consumes the interval, and that is correct
//     rather than merely tolerable: the lock holder is another writer checkpointing this same
//     session right now, so the thing the heartbeat wanted is already happening.
//
// An unwritable marker returns false rather than proceeding: running a full checkpoint on every
// tool call because the marker cannot be persisted is strictly worse than no heartbeat, and Stop
// still covers the turn end.
