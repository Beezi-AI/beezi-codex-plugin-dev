// One answer to "is this machine linked, and is it reporting?".
//
// It exists because there used to be three. `performLogin` asked getCredentials() (raw read, no
// refresh), me.mjs asked getAccessToken() (refresh-aware, wipes on invalid_grant), and each phrased
// the outcome differently — so the MCP tool could say "already linked" in the same minute a script
// said "not linked". Worse, the two run in different environments: the MCP server is spawned by
// Codex and inherits BEEZI_API_URL, while a script the model runs through the shell tool may not,
// leaving them pointed at different APIs with the same credentials. Every answer therefore carries
// the `apiBase` it was computed against, so a disagreement is visible instead of baffling.
