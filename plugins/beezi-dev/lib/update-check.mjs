// ── Stale-version check (G-8-4) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The audit called this "blocked upstream", and half of that was right: NOTHING HERE UPDATES
// ANYTHING. What was never blocked is the part that matters — the plugin has always carried its
// own version and nothing read it, so a user running a six-month-old build had no way to find out.
//
// M-8-3 is now ANSWERED, and the answer is yes-with-a-caveat: Codex does support remote (Git)
// marketplaces — `codex plugin marketplace add|upgrade` — but has no `plugin update` verb. See
// updateNotice() for the command that stands in for one, and for where it came from.
//
// So this is a reader and a sentence, not an updater. It compares the installed version against
// the version published in the manifest the build was stamped with (env.json updateManifestUrl,
// written by scripts/make-variant.sh for a variant and by scripts/sync-to-github.sh for the public
// build) and says so once an hour at most.
//
// R1: "Do not add an unverified `version` property to Codex's marketplace schema. A Beezi-owned
// update manifest or fetching the referenced plugin manifest can serve the update checker." This
// fetches the referenced PLUGIN manifest — `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, which already has a
// version because Codex's own schema puts one there. Nothing is invented.

// How long a fetched reading is trusted. One hour, matching the Claude plugin: the internal
// pipeline publishes several times a day, so a longer window hides the very updates this exists
// to surface. The cost is bounded by FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS, which is tightened to match — at one
// request an hour it can land inside far more SessionStart hooks than a daily one could.
