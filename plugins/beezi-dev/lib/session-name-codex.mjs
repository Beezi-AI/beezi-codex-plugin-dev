// This was written when the index looked originator-gated, and that is no longer true. Re-measured

// install this is the primary source and sessionNameFrom below is the compatibility fallback — the
// reverse of the old reading. (Subagent rollouts are never indexed, 0/11, and never need to be:
// checkpoint.mjs bills them under the parent session, so they inherit its name.)
//
// Two records per session is the normal shape, and the ORDER MATTERS: Codex seeds the index with
// the user's raw opening prompt truncated to ~36 characters, then replaces it with the AI title
// 3-12s later. Both consequences are handled below — the raw seed is prompt text and must be
