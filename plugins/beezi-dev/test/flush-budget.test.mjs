// Codex kills a hook at its registered timeout and reports the kill as a failed hook. The queue
// flush is a serial loop with a per-request bound but no overall one, so N pending reports against
// a stalled API cost N × the per-request timeout: six queued reports measured 24.9s against a 10s
// budget. The reports that landed before the kill were tracked, which is why this surfaced as
// "hook exited with code 1" *and* working analytics.

// tmpHome() also seeds `files` queued segments, so a test starts from a queue of known depth.

// lib/, and the fixtures module deliberately imports nothing from the code under test.
