# Beezi: analytics hooks

Codex does not load hooks bundled inside a plugin — its `plugin_hooks` feature is `removed`, so an
installed plugin contributes nothing to the hook engine. Beezi's lifecycle hooks are therefore
written into the user-level registry `~/.codex/hooks.json` by the script below, and **must then be
trusted once by the user**.

## Finding the script

This file is at `<plugin-root>/skills/analytics-hooks/SKILL.md`, so the script is at
`<plugin-root>/scripts/hooks.mjs`. Use the absolute path. Run exactly one command per request; do
not read or inspect any other files.

## Commands

| The user wants | Do |
| --- | --- |
| to know the current state, or asks why analytics are empty | call the **`beezi_status` tool** |
| to start reporting, or to repair a broken/stale install | `node "<plugin-root>/scripts/hooks.mjs" install` |
| to stop reporting | `node "<plugin-root>/scripts/hooks.mjs" uninstall` |

Prefer `beezi_status` for any read-only question: it reports the hook state *and* the link state,
and answering "why is nothing tracked?" needs both. `node "<plugin-root>/scripts/hooks.mjs" status`
gives the hook half only, and exists for terminal use.

If the request is ambiguous, check status first — it changes nothing.

## After installing: the trust step

`install` only writes the registry. **Codex will not run a hook it has not been shown**, so tell the
user, clearly and every time:

> Run `/hooks` in Codex, review the Beezi entries, and trust them.

There is no non-interactive way to grant that trust — do not try to bypass it, and do not claim
analytics are working until the user confirms they have done it. Trust is recorded against each
hook's **hash**, so this has to be repeated after any change to the hooks, including a plugin
upgrade.

**A plugin upgrade always needs this doing again.** Each registry entry carries the absolute path
of the plugin version's hook script in its `arguments`, so an upgrade moves the scripts out from
under them: `status` reports `stale`, and the machine reports nothing until the user runs `install`
and re-trusts. Tell them both halves — re-installing without re-trusting leaves them exactly as
stuck.

## Reading the status output

- **installed** — every event's entry points at this plugin version's scripts. If analytics still
  are not arriving, the likely cause is the missing trust step above, or that the machine is not
  linked (see the `me` and `login` skills).
- **absent** — nothing installed yet. Run `install`.
- **stale** — a plugin upgrade moved the scripts and the registry entries still point at the old
  version (or they are the launcher-style entries an older plugin wrote). Run `install`, then
  re-trust via `/hooks`.
- **partial** — an incomplete install. Run `install`.

## What the hooks do

One entry per lifecycle event: `SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, and — for tracking spawned
subagents — `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop`. `install` and `status` both print the list back, so
check `/hooks` against what the script named rather than against a count.

The two subagent hooks only record which agent ran and when. A subagent's *usage* is billed by the
parent session's own checkpoint, which finds subagent rollouts itself. So if the user trusts only
some of the entries, subagent tokens are still reported; what is lost is the agent's task name and
its exact span on the session timeline.

## Scope of what is written

`install` writes `~/.codex/hooks.json` only. Each entry runs `node` from PATH with the hook
script's absolute path in `arguments` — no launcher scripts are written any more, and `install`
sweeps away the `~/.beezi-codex/hooks/` launchers an older plugin version left. It **merges**:
any hooks the user configured themselves keep their place and content. `uninstall` removes only
Beezi's entries, and deletes the registry file only if Beezi's entries were the only thing in it.
Report this if the user is worried about their own hooks.

## Reporting without hooks

If the user does not want to install hooks, analytics can still be captured on demand — the `track`
skill checkpoints the current branch and needs no hooks at all.
