// ── The entry-point guard (R1) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// R-numbers cite docs/plans/2026-09-10-sections/REVIEW.md.
//
// THE RULE, stated once for every entry point: no upload, no drain and no credential work while the
// data root is mid-cutover or its environment cannot be established. Hooks reach it through
// hookMayProceed(), CLI scripts through cliMayProceed() (which prints the reason it refuses), and
// SessionStart also surfaces environmentNotice().
//
// Validated per OPERATION, not once per process: a resident MCP server spans recovery and
// migrations. A refused check is retryable; authentication must not replace the evidence first.
